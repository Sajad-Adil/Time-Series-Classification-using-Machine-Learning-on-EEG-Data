# ðŸ§  EEG Signal Classification Using ML and DL

This project aims to classify EEG time series data using both machine learning and deep learning techniques to evaluate their effectiveness in identifying different brain activity patterns.

The [Bonn EEG dataset](https://www.ukbonn.de/epileptologie/arbeitsgruppen/ag-lehnertz-neurophysik/downloads/) is used as the primary data source.
